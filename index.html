			<h2>School History</h2>
			<p class = "general-info">Henry M. Jackson High School, which is widely referred to as Jackson High School, opened its doors in 1994 as a public high school in the Everett School District. Named after Henry M. Jackson, the late Washington-native U.S Senator, this school has quickly flourished to serve 2,196 students. Despite this large number, the graduation rate for Jackson High School has come to an all-time high of 95% due to the perseverance of both staff and students.</p>
