    <h2>What is TSA?</h2>
    <p class = "general-info">Technology Student Association (TSA) is a national organization that allows students to engage and compete in events related to science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). The TSA competition structure is divided into three conferences: Regionals, State, and Nationals. Groups and/or individuals must compete and place in each conference to be able to participate in the next. TSA’s membership includes more than 250,000 students across the United States in the middle and high school level.</p>

  <div id = "creed">
  <h2>Creed</h2>
  <p class = "general-info">I believe that Technology Education holds an important place in my life in the technical world. I believe there is a need for the development of good attitudes concerning work, tools, materials, experimentation, and processes of industry. Guided by my teachers, artisans from industry, and my own initiative, I will strive to do my best in making my school, community, state, and nation better places in which to live.
I will accept the responsibilities that are mine. I will accept the theories that are supported by proper evidence. I will explore on my own for safer, more effective methods of working and living. I will strive to develop a cooperative attitude and will exercise tact and respect for other individuals. Through the work of my hands and mind, I will express my ideas to the best of my ability. I will make it my goal to do better each day the task before me, and to be steadfast in my belief in my God, and my fellow Americans.</p>

    <h2>Chapter Advisor</h2>
    <p class = "general-info">Ms. Judy Baker has been Jackson High School’s TSA chapter advisor for six years. Given her experience in being an advisor and teaching college-level English, she possesses a variety of skills by which she can clearly communicate with members and run the chapter smoothly. Ever since she has taken up the role of an advisor, the chapter has flourished greatly. Without Ms. Baker’s guidance, our TSA club would not have been as successful and organized as it is now.</p>

      Our officers have done a stupendous job of handling the chapter and organizing meetings in order to guide other members. They implement TSA’s motto of leadership by being open to help chapter members at meetings. In order to answer questions and communicate with members outside of meetings, they have set up Remind, a private mobile messaging platform, through which they can reach everyone in the chapter.

    <h3>Octoberfest</h3>
    <p class = "general-info">Last October, our TSA chapter volunteered to help run the 2019 Octoberfest event held at Jackson High School, where elementary school kids had an opportunity to get into the Halloween spirit, play games, win prizes, and most importantly, have fun! Members from our TSA chapter were in charge of hosting a photo booth and painting backdrops so children could take pictures and remember the enjoyable night. </p>
